# MobiGuard - Mobile Theft Detection with Blockchain

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a blockchain-based mobile theft detection project. The project aims to address the rising issue of mobile phone thefts or losses by leveraging blockchain technology. It comprises two main modules: Alert Propagation in Blockchain Systems and Theft Detection and Event Monitoring.

## Motivation
Mobile phones have become indispensable in todayâ€™s digital era, serving both personal and professional needs. However, the increase in dependency on mobile phones has led to an alarming rise in mobile thefts or losses, resulting in data loss and compromised user privacy. Research studies reveal that approximately 70 million smartphones are lost or stolen each year, with a minimal percentage being recovered. Given this alarming situation, there is an urgent need for mobile theft prevention techniques that can safeguard user data and privacy.

## Solution
Blockchain technology holds great potential to address the mobile theft detection problem due to its decentralized and immutable nature. In this project, we explore how blockchain technology can be utilized for anti-theft and mobile security purposes. By leveraging its decentralized, secure, transparent, and trustworthy nature, we aim to securely store user data, authenticate users, and detect unauthorized individuals attempting to register stolen or lost phones.

## Features
- Registration of mobile phones on the blockchain with unique identifiers.
- Tracking the status of mobile devices (e.g., "Sold," "Stolen," "Not sold").
- Immutable storage of device ownership and transaction history.
- Automated operations such as selling, purchasing, and reporting as stolen through smart contracts.
- Location-based tracking using GPS data to aid in detecting theft.
- Manufacturer algorithm for device registration.
- Selling algorithm for successful device sales.
- Reporting loss algorithm for reporting devices as lost or stolen.

## Algorithms
### Manufacturer Algorithm
- Manufacturer registers the smartphone on the private blockchain upon manufacturing.

### Selling Algorithm
- Device owner information and location are updated upon successful sale.

### Reporting Loss Algorithm
- Device status is updated to "Lost," and the device's location is monitored upon reporting loss by the owner.

## Future Work
In the upcoming weeks, we plan to implement Module 2: Theft Detection and Event Monitoring. This module will focus on enhancing theft detection capabilities and improving event monitoring functionalities.
