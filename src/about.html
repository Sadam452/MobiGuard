          <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">In this project, we will thoroughly research and implement
            two modules: Module 1: Alert Propagation
            in Blockchain Systems, and Module 2:
            Theft Detection and Event Monitoring. In this
            report, we will cover Module 1, which focuses on alert
            propagation in blockchain systems, and in the upcoming
            weeks, we will begin work on the next module.
            Mobile phones have become indispensable in today’s
            digital era, serving both personal and professional
            needs. However, the increase in dependency
            on mobile phones has led to an alarming rise in mobile
            thefts or losses, resulting in data loss and compromised
            user privacy. Research studies reveal that
            approximately 70 million smartphones are lost(or
            stolen) each year, with less than 7% of them being
            recovered [1]. Furthermore, company-issued phones
            are not immune to these breaches, with 4.3% of them
            being lost or stolen annually. Workplaces and conference
            environments are the primary locations for
            mobile thefts, with the number of incidents increasing
            by 39.2% between 2019 and 2021 [2]. Given this
            alarming situation, there is an urgent need for mobile
            theft prevention techniques that can safeguard user
            data and privacy.
            Blockchain technology holds great potential to address
            the mobile theft detection problem. With its
            decentralized and immutable nature, blockchain can
            help retrieve lost or stolen smartphones, or at the
            very least, prevent misuse by unauthorized parties.
            Although blockchain technology has not been widely
            adopted nationally or internationally for mobile theft
            detection, many companies are exploring its use for
            mobile security and anti-theft solutions. Internationally,
            companies like Samsung and Huawei are conducting
            research on the use of blockchain technology
            for mobile security, with Samsung filing several
            patents for blockchain-based mobile security solutions
            [3, 4].
            Therefore, in this report, we present how
            blockchain technology can be utilized for anti-theft
            and mobile security purposes, leveraging its decentralized,
            secure, transparent, and trustworthy nature
            [5]. We will delve into how blockchain and smart
            contracts can securely store user data, authenticate
            users, and detect unauthorized individuals attempting
            to register stolen or lost phones.</p>

            Methodology
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">Each mobile phone can be registered by the manufacturing
            company with a unique identifier, such as
            the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)
            number. When a device is purchased by a user, the
            company inserts a transaction into the blockchain indicating
            the purchase and updating the owner of the
            device. Other parameters, such as the ”status of the
            device,” are also updated, with possible values including
            ”Sold,” ”Stolen,” or ”Not sold.” Initially, when a
            device is manufactured, its status is set to ”Not sold.”
            When a legitimate user purchases the device, the status
            is updated to ”Sold,” and if the device is lost or
            stolen, the legitimate owner can update the status to
            ”Lost/stolen.”
            The immutable property of the blockchain ensures
            that unauthorized users cannot claim ownership of a
            stolen device, as tampering with the entire blockchain
            is nearly impossible. Additionally, the blockchain can
            track other information, such as the location of devices
            using GPS trackers. This location data can aid
            in detecting the thief. Smart contracts automate operations
            such as ”sell,” ”purchase,” and ”report as
            stolen.”
            If a device is purchased by a user from a previous
            owner, the history of owners is maintained in the
            blockchain. This ensures that only legitimate devices
            are available in the market, and illegal devices cannot
            be sold or purchased. Location-based tracking can
            send signals to the owner who reported the device as
            lost, enabling them to track the device’s location.</p>
